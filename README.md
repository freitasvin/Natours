## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to create a landing page for a company that sell tours packs to people.

## What I Learned üí° <a name = "what_i_learned"></a>

During the development of this project, I explored a range of advanced CSS techniques and web development concepts, including:

- Utilization of modern CSS techniques, such as `clip-path`, `background-clip`, `background-blend-mode`, `shape-outside`, `backdrop-filter`, `object-fit`, `transform`, `perspective`, custom CSS properties and others to create stunning designs and effects;
- Implementation of advanced CSS animations with `@keyframes`, `animation`, and `transition`;
- Exploration of advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements necessary for modern CSS development;
- Understanding of how CSS works behind the scenes, including concepts such as the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, positioning schemes, and stacking contexts;
- Adoption of CSS architecture practices, such as the 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, and writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code;
- Introduction to the Sass preprocessor, including variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;
- Application of Sass in real-world projects, including setting global variables, promoting code reusability, architecting CSS, and managing media queries;
- Utilization of the NPM ecosystem to set up a development process for compiling Sass and automatically reloading the browser, and creating a build process for concatenating, prefixing, and compressing CSS files;
- Implementation of modern responsive design techniques, including fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, and the use of media queries to ensure a consistent experience across different devices;
- Adoption of advanced responsive design workflows, such as mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, breakpoint selection, em vs rem units, and feature queries to test browser support;
- Utilization of responsive images and videos in HTML and CSS to optimize page loading times and enhance the user experience.
